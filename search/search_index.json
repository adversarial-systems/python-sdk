If those models have high enough confidence, that's your answer. But if the models are unsure, then the images are progressively escalated to more resource-intensive analysis methods up to real-time human review. So what you get is a computer vision system that starts working right away without even needing to first gather and label a dataset. At first it will operate with high latency, because people need to review the image queries. But over time, the ML systems will learn and improve so queries come back faster with higher confidence.</p> <p>Note: The SDK is currently in \"beta\" phase.

The longer you can wait for an answer to your image query, the better accuracy you can get. In particular, if the ML models are unsure of the best response, they will escalate the image query to more intensive analysis with more complex models and real-time human monitors as needed. Your code can easily wait for this delayed response. Either way, these new results are automatically trained into your models so your next queries will get better results faster.</p> <p>The desired confidence level is set as the escalation threshold on your detector. This determines what is the minimum confidence score for the ML system to provide before the image query is escalated.</p> <p>For example, say you want to set your desired confidence level to 0.95, but that you're willing to wait up to 60 seconds to get a confident response.</p> <pre><code>d = gl.get_or_create_detector(name=\"trash\", query=\"Is the trash can full?\", confidence=0.95)\nimage_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=d, image=jpeg_img, wait=60)\n# This will wait until either 60 seconds have passed or the confidence reaches 0.95\nprint(f\"The answer is {image_query.result}\")\n</code></pre> <p>Or if you want to run as fast as possible, set <code>wait=0</code>. This way you will only get the ML results, without waiting for escalation. Image queries which are below the desired confidence level still be escalated for further analysis, and the results are incorporated as training data to improve your ML model, but your code will not wait for that to happen.</p> <pre><code>image_query = gl.submit_image_query(detector=d, image=jpeg_img, wait=0)\n</code></pre> <p>If the returned result was generated from an ML model, you can see the confidence score returned for the image query:</p> <pre><code>print(f\"The confidence is {image_query.result.confidence}\")\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"working-with-detectors/","title":"Working with Detectors","text":""},{"location":"working-with-detectors/#explicitly-create-a-new-detector","title":"Explicitly create a new detector","text":"<p>Typically you'll use the <code>get_or_create_detector(name: str, query: str)</code> method to find an existing detector you've already created with the same name, or create a new one if it doesn't exists.
