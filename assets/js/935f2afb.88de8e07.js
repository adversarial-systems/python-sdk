This document will guide you through creating a complete application. If the dog is detected on the couch, the application will play a pre-recorded sound over the computer\'s speakers, instructing the dog to get off the couch.

The longer you can wait for an answer to your image query, the better accuracy you can get. In particular, if the ML models are unsure of the best response, they will escalate the image query to more intensive analysis with more complex models and real-time human monitors as needed. Your code can easily wait for this delayed response. Either way, these new results are automatically trained into your models so your next queries will get better results faster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/retail-analytics":{"id":"getting-started/retail-analytics","title":"A Serious Example: Retail Analytics","description":"Tracking utilization of a customer service counter","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/installation":{"id":"installation/installation","title":"Installation","description":"Welcome to the Groundlight SDK installation guide.
