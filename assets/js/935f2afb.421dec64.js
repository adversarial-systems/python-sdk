This is useful for times in which the thread or process or machine submitting image queries is not the same thread or machine that will be retrieving and using the results. For example, you might have a forward deployed robot or camera that submits image queries to Groundlight, and a separate server that retrieves the results and takes action based on them. We will refer to these two machines as the submitting machine and the retrieving machine.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/building-applications":{"id":"building-applications/building-applications","title":"Building Applications","description":"Groundlight provides a powerful \\"computer vision powered by natural language\\" system that enables you to build visual applications with minimal code.

The longer you can wait for an answer to your image query, the better accuracy you can get. In particular, if the ML models are unsure of the best response, they will escalate the image query to more intensive analysis with more complex models and real-time human monitors as needed. Your code can easily wait for this delayed response. Either way, these new results are automatically trained into your models so your next queries will get better results faster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/sample-applications":{"id":"building-applications/sample-applications","title":"Sample Applications","description":"Explore these GitHub repositories to see examples of Groundlight-powered applications:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/working-with-detectors":{"id":"building-applications/working-with-detectors","title":"Working with Detectors","description":"Explicitly create a new detector","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/api-tokens":{"id":"getting-started/api-tokens","title":"API Tokens","description":"About API Tokens","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/dog-on-couch":{"id":"getting-started/dog-on-couch","title":"A Fun Example: Dog-on-Couch Detector","description":"Here is a whimsical example of how you could use Groundlight in your home to keep your dog off the couch.
