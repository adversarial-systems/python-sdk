With Groundlight, you can quickly create applications for various use cases, from simple object detection to complex visual analysis.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/edge":{"id":"building-applications/edge","title":"Using Groundlight on the edge","description":"Starting your model evaluations at the edge reduces latency, cost, network bandwidth, and energy. Once you have downloaded and installed your Groundlight edge models, you can configure the Groundlight SDK to use your edge environment by configuring the \'endpoint\' which the SDK connects to.  You can do this either directly in code as such:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/grabbing-images":{"id":"building-applications/grabbing-images","title":"Grabbing Images","description":"Groundlight\'s SDK accepts images in many popular formats, including PIL, OpenCV, and numpy arrays.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/handling-errors":{"id":"building-applications/handling-errors","title":"Handling Server Errors","description":"When building applications with the Groundlight SDK, you may encounter server errors during API calls.

The longer you can wait for an answer to your image query, the better accuracy you can get. In particular, if the ML models are unsure of the best response, they will escalate the image query to more intensive analysis with more complex models and real-time human monitors as needed. Your code can easily wait for this delayed response. Either way, these new results are automatically trained into your models so your next queries will get better results faster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"building-applications/working-with-detectors":{"id":"building-applications/working-with-detectors","title":"Working with Detectors","description":"Explicitly create a new detector","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/api-tokens":{"id":"getting-started/api-tokens","title":"API Tokens","description":"About API Tokens","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"getting-started/dog-on-couch":{"id":"getting-started/dog-on-couch","title":"A Fun Example: Dog-on-Couch Detector","description":"Here is a whimsical example of how you could use Groundlight in your home to keep your dog off the couch.
