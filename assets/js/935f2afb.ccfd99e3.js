The longer you can wait for an answer to your image query, the better accuracy you can get. In particular, if the ML models are unsure of the best response, they will escalate the image query to more intensive analysis with more complex models and real-time human monitors as needed. Your code can easily wait for this delayed response. Either way, these new results are automatically trained into your models so your next queries will get better results faster.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/libraries-numpy-pil":{"id":"installation/libraries-numpy-pil","title":"Numpy, PIL, OpenCV - using common libraries","description":"Smaller is better!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"installation/linux-windows-mac":{"id":"installation/linux-windows-mac","title":"Windows, Linux, Mac","description":"Installation on common platforms is simple.
